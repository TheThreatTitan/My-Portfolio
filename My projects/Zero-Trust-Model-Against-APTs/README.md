# Zero Trust Model Defense Against Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)

## Overview
This project implements an effective Zero Trust security model to defend against Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) in a simulated enterprise environment. The implementation was done on Windows Server 2019 and includes the following key components:
- Endpoint Security: Deployed to monitor and secure endpoints.
- Privileged Access Management (PAM): Designed to restrict and monitor privileged accounts.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implemented to enforce least privilege access.
- BitLocker Drive Encryption: Enabled to protect data at rest.
- Security Enhancements: Recommended to improve the overall security posture of the enterprise.

## Objectives
- To demonstrate the effectiveness of a Zero Trust model in mitigating APTs.
- To provide a practical implementation guide for securing enterprise environments.
- To highlight the importance of layered security measures in modern cybersecurity.

## Technologies Used
- Operating System: Windows Server 2019
- Tools: 
  - Endpoint Security Solutions
  - Privileged Access Management (PAM)
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
  - BitLocker Drive Encryption
- Methodologies: Zero Trust Architecture, Defense-in-Depth

## Implementation Steps
1. Endpoint Security Deployment:
   - Installed and configured endpoint security tools to monitor and block malicious activities.
2. Privileged Access Management (PAM):
   - Designed and implemented PAM to restrict access to sensitive systems and data.
3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
   - Configured RBAC policies to enforce least privilege access across the enterprise.
4. BitLocker Drive Encryption:
   - Enabled BitLocker to encrypt all drives and protect data at rest.
5. Security Enhancements:
   - Recommended additional security measures, such as network segmentation, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and regular security audits.

## Results
- Improved the overall security posture of the simulated enterprise.
- Successfully mitigated potential APT attacks by implementing a layered defense strategy.
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of Zero Trust principles in real-world scenarios.

## How to Use This Repository
- Documentation: Refer to the zero-trust-model-lab-guide/ folder for detailed implementation guides and screenshots.

## Future Enhancements
- Extend the implementation to include cloud environments (e.g., Azure, AWS).
- Integrate AI-based threat detection systems for real-time APT mitigation.
- Conduct penetration testing to validate the effectiveness of the Zero Trust model.
